# Datify
Google Apps Script library for working with tabular data in Sheets. The library creates two custom classes, datarray and datarange. Datarray is an object for working with two dimensional arrays of data ([[header1, header2],[rowVal1,rowVal2]]), and the datarange object is for working with tabular data in a named range once it has been placed into a Google sheet.

## Datarray

[datarray](https://github.com/BryanJacques/Datify/blob/main/Datarray.md) function accepts two dimensional array in following format:
```
  [
    ['col 1 header','col 2 header','col 3 header]
    ,['row 1 col 1','row 1 col 2','row 1 col 3']
    ,['row 2 col 1','row 2 col 2','row 2 col 3']
  ]
```
and it returns an object with methods to work with tabular data.

## Datarange

datarange function accepts the name of a named range as input and returns an object with methods to work with data placed on a Google sheet.
